### Project Description
ZapRent is a smart micro-rental platform that allows users to instantly rent essential gadgets like chargers, power banks, and earphones for short durations. It solves the common problem of forgetting gadgets by providing fast, affordable, and convenient access in places like colleges and public spaces. ZapRent promotes a sharing economy while reducing unnecessary electronic waste.

### The Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, essential electronic gadgets like chargers, power banks, earphones, and adapters are a daily necessity. However, people often forget these items at home, especially in fast-paced environments like colleges, offices, libraries, and public spaces. When this happens, they are left with limited options - either borrow from someone, which may be inconvenient, or purchase a new gadget for temporary use, which is expensive and leads to unnecessary electronic waste. There is currently no efficient, affordable, and instant solution for short-term gadget emergencies.

### The Solution
ZapRent is a smart micro-rental web platform designed to provide instant access to essential electronic gadgets for short durations. Users can log in, check real-time gadget availability, select a rental duration, and securely rent the gadget when needed. By enabling temporary access instead of permanent ownership, ZapRent offers a cost-effective, convenient, and sustainable solution that promotes a sharing economy while reducing unnecessary electronic waste.
